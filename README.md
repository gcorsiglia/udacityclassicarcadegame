# Classic Arcade Game Clone

This game was built using Object-Oriented Javascript. This game is a clone of the classic arcade game, Frogger. This is the third project in the [Udacity Front-end Development Nanodegree program](https://www.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd001).

## How to Play the Game

The object of the game is to make get across the board, from the grass to the water. Collect gems along the way to earn points. But be careful of the bugs - you will lose points and have to start over each time your player collides with a bug. Use arrow keys to move your player across the board.

A working demo of the game can be found at [ginasaysyes.com](http://www.ginasaysyes.com/classicarcadegame/)

## Acknowledgments

The starter code for this project was provided by Udacity, including HTML, image assets, and much of the engine and resource js files.
